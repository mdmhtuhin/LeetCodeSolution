## Description

You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer array `cost` of the same length, where `cost[i]` is the cost to delete the `ith` character of `s`.

You may delete any number of characters from `s` (possibly none), such that the resulting string is non-empty and consists of equal characters.

Return an integer denoting the minimum total deletion cost required.

 
Example 1:


Input: s = "aabaac", cost = [1,2,3,4,1,10]

Output: 11

Explanation:

Deleting the characters at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 results in the string `"c"`, which consists of equal characters, and the total cost is `cost[0] + cost[1] + cost[2] + cost[3] + cost[4] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 11`.


Example 2:


Input: s = "abc", cost = [10,5,8]

Output: 13

Explanation:

Deleting the characters at indices 1 and 2 results in the string `"a"`, which consists of equal characters, and the total cost is `cost[1] + cost[2] = 5 + 8 = 13`.


Example 3:


Input: s = "zzzzz", cost = [67,67,67,67,67]

Output: 0

Explanation:

All characters in `s` are equal, so the deletion cost is 0.


 
Constraints:


	`n == s.length == cost.length`
	`1 <= n <= 105`
	`1 <= cost[i] <= 109`
	`s` consists of lowercase English letters.
