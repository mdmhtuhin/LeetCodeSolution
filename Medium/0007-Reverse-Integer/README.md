## Description

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 
Example 1:

```

Input: x = 123
Output: 321

```

Example 2:

```

Input: x = -123
Output: -321

```

Example 3:

```

Input: x = 120
Output: 21

```

 
Constraints:


	`-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
